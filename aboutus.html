            -  Tell us a bit about your self: The history of pizza begins in antiquity, 
        when various ancient cultures produced basic flatbreads with several toppings.
<p>
        The precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia, a flat bread known to the 
        Romans as panis focacius,[1] to which toppings were then added.[2] Modern 
        pizza developed in Naples, when tomato was added to the focaccia in the late
         18th century.[citation needed]
        </p>
    <p></p>    
        The word pizza was first documented in 997 CE in Gaeta[3] and successively in 
        different parts of Central and Southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten in the country
         of Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II, when Allied 
        troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.
